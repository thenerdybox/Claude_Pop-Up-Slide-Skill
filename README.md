# Pop-Up Slide

A Claude skill that generates animated, transparent
slide-in popup overlays for livestreaming — built for OBS Browser Source,
so it works the same whether you're pushing to Twitch, TikTok, Kick,
Trovo, or YouTube.

Tell Claude what you want to advertise, answer a few setup questions, and
it hands you a ready-to-use overlay: a small badge that slides in from a
corner, cycles through your slides, slides back out, pauses, and repeats
— on loop, indefinitely.

## What it does

- **Interviews you first** — whether your logo/image stays the same
  across every slide or changes per slide, how long each slide should
  stay on screen, how long the pause should be before it loops again,
  what each slide should say, and your brand colors/fonts if you have
  them (it'll read a brand kit if you provide one, rather than guessing).
- **Generates exactly two files** — a self-contained HTML "engine"
  (no external dependencies besides an optional Google Fonts import) and
  a `settings.js` file holding your actual content, so future edits never
  require touching animation code.
- **Fixed 640×220 size** on every campaign, so overlays stay visually
  consistent with each other over time.
- **Truly transparent background** — drops straight into OBS as a
  Browser Source, no green-screen chroma key needed.

## Usage

1. Install this skill into your Claude setup (skills directory, or via
   the Claude skill catalog if you're using Claude.ai/Claude Code).
2. Ask Claude something like: *"build me a stream popup ad for
   [brand/game/server]"*.
3. Answer the setup questions it asks.
4. In OBS: **Sources → + → Browser Source → check "Local file"** → point
   it at the generated `.html` file → set **Width: 640, Height: 220**.
5. Edit `settings.js` any time afterward to change text, timing, or
   colors — the HTML engine file shouldn't need touching again.

end — including how it handled a provided brand kit, respected a brand
color with a reserved meaning, and picked a logo variant for legibility
at small size.

## License

Add whatever license fits your use — MIT is a common choice for a skill
like this if you're open to others reusing or modifying it.
